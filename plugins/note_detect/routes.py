"""Server routes for the note_detect plugin.

POST /api/plugins/note_detect/recording
    Body: raw bytes of a RIFF/WAVE file (mono PCM is what the browser
    encodes; we don't crack it open, just validate the header).
    Query: ?slug=<safe-filename-slug>   (optional, defaults to "recording").
    Returns JSON: { path_in_container, relative_path, filename, bytes }.

POST /api/plugins/note_detect/live-judgment
    Body: JSON object — one judgment record produced by the detector.
    Query: ?session=<id>   (sanitised; defaults to "default").
    Returns JSON: { ok: true, appended: <bytes> }.
    Appends one JSON line to
    ``static/note_detect_recordings/live_<session>.jsonl``. The plugin
    streams judgments here only when tuning mode is on, so steady-state
    play has zero overhead. Each line is a self-contained record —
    safe to tail / read partially / replay.

Both endpoints write under ``<static>/note_detect_recordings/``, where
``<static>`` is resolved as ``$STATIC_DIR`` (set by native uvicorn
launches and the desktop bundle) and falls back to ``/app/static``
(the in-container bind mount). The directory is created lazily on the
first write so route registration can never fail on a host where the
static tree doesn't exist yet — the route stays mounted, and a real
filesystem problem turns into a clean 500 on save.

We deliberately don't write to ``config_dir`` here even though it's the
"correct" home for plugin state — config_dir is a named Docker volume in
the dev compose, so the host can't reach files inside it from outside
the container. The static tree IS bind-mounted (or repo-relative on
native / desktop runs), which is what we need.
